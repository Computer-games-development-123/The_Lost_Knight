The Lost Knight – ForestHub & Green Forest Demo

This is a small prototype for my 2D action game "The Lost Knight".

What’s included in this build:
- ForestHub scene with an NPC (Yoji) and a locked gate.
- Dialogue system (press ↑ to talk).
- Gate that unlocks only after talking to Yoji.
- Green Forest combat arena with enemy waves and a first boss.
- Basic combat, health bar, enemy spawning and boss fight.

Controls:
- Move: A / D or Left / Right Arrows
- Jump: Space
- Attack: X
- Interact (talk / enter gate): Up Arrow

This is a coursework prototype focused on the core gameplay loop.
